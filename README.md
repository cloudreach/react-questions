# react-questions
Clone this repo for our React interview.

There are 4 questions, each with its own directory. For each question, use the instructions here to
know what to do. Do all the work for each question inside that question's directory.

## Question 1
Improve the three given code samples by utilising idiomatic ES6 features. Each file, `part1.js`,
`part2.js`, and `part3.js`, has comments describing what could be improved.

## Question 2
Write a simple react component for a Card using es6 syntax. This component has no props and should
just render its children inside a div with the class "card".

We have created a file and imported React at the top, add the component in there.

## Question 3
We have a component that is managing its own state. Refactor it so the state is managed using Redux.

## Question 4
There is a bug in the `Accordion` component where it doesn't correctly expand. Can you fix it? It may be something
to do with component lifecycles.
