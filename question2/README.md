# Cloudreach React Question 2

Write a simple react component for a Card using es6 syntax. This component has no props and should
just render its children inside a div with the class "card".

We have created a file and imported React at the top, add the component in there.

## What to do

1. Define a simple `Card` component in `src/Card.jsx`
2. Update `src/index.js` to render the `Card` component to the `root` element in the document.

## Running the project
