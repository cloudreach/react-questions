# Cloudreach React Question 3

We have a component that is managing its own state. Refactor it so the state is managed using Redux.

## What to do

1. Implement the Redux backend.
2. Lift the state out of the `Filter` component and manage it with Redux.
3. Update the `ItemList` component to that it displays the filtered items.
